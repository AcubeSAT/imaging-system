# Extra
- Temperature in the cleanroom is 21.7Â°C
- The steps while adjusting the program settings (for deviation 014) more spesifically are: 
   - While using the new unused cable the POWER display on the camera turns on, and the STATUS 1 display keeps blinking
   - CamTool doesn't detect the device
   - XiCOP says the Firmware (CPU/Flash) is corrupted
   - Attempt to update the firmware through XiCOP
   - Because it detected the firmware as corrupted, it requires the model number
   - No option in the dropdown to select the device
   - "Do you want to fix the camera flash file system?" yes
   - Failed because it doesn't support the serial number
   - Retry, now the models are shown in the dropdown and the correct one was selected
   - Error on "updating firmware cannot open usb3 device using ximea driver"
   - New error that says again that no firmware is supported for the camera appears
